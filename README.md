This is a decentralized app built on the Polygon blockchain. Right now it is deployed on the Amoy testnet. You can use metamask to connect to the app

Steps to run the project -

# Backend
1. `cd .\backend\bot-api\`
2. `pip install flask flask_cors python-dotenv google-generativeai`
3. `python .\main.py`

Based on connectivity issues, the API might take a bit to initialize and start.

2. `npm i`
3. `npm run dev`
